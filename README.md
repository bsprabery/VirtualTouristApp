# VirtualTourist (Swift)

## Overview
VirtualTourist is an app that allows users to "tour" the world using their
iOS device. Users may drop pins at any location and the app will
automatically download a collection of images from Flickr posted in that
area. Users may choose to delete selected photos from the collection or
load an entirely new collection of photos for that location using the "New
Collection" button. Pins may be deleted from the map.

## Setup
VirtualTourist should run without any additional setup.
